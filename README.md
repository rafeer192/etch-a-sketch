# etch-a-sketch
A drawing app that mimics a child's sketchpad. The user moves their mouse through the canvas to draw whatever they want. They do not need 
to hold down their mouse button to draw, just glide across the canvas. There will be options for increasing the number of boxes for 
more detail and better resolution, as well as options to change color.
